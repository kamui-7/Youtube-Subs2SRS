# YT Subs2SRS
This is basically the youtube version of Subs2SRS, where all you have to do is enter a link, and a full-fledged anki deck with audio and pictures will created. So this eliminates the need for having to download a video, or the accompanying subtitles, and retiming them and having to deal with TSV files to export to anki! This is pretty simple but I'll leave some instructions below

## Installation
1. Install the addon with the code,`1633834851` and restart anki
2. Enter the youtube link for the video
3. Choose an output folder for the audio and screenshots to go (can also be used for condensed audio)
4. Choose the appropriate note type, and fields for where you want the audio and sentences, and pictures to go
5. Pick a language that subtitles are in
6. Hit generate, and after a bit, refresh your decks and you should see a deck named after the title of the video!

## Features
- Fallback to auto gen subs if it couldn't find man made captions
- Set a limit to how many cards are generated
- Choose the dimensions of the pictures
- Fast card generation

## Bugs
The crop feature isn't working due to anki packaging issues
